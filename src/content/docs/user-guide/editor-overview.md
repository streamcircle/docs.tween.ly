The Editor is composed of several sections:

- In the **top bar**, in addition to the main menu, there are actions for a graphic file.
- In the **left sidebar**, there are buttons for adding basic objects - rectangle, text, image. Objects can be nested in hierarchical structures. The object tree is used to visualize this structure.
- In the **middle** is a scene with a canvas that can be managed with the tools above. The canvas shows the visual form of all objects in the scene.
- The **right sidebar** contains tools for setting the properties of individual objects or animations.
- Animations are rendered in the panel at the **bottom** of the screen. Above the timeline are the tools for setting the timeline, and below the timeline is a drag-and-drop playhead, playback actions, and parameters for setting timeline properties.

## Graphics File

The graphic file consists of the **graphic scene** itself, and **metadata** describing the file:

- **Title** - The main name of the graphics file.
- **Description** - Graphics file description, displayed in the graphics file detail in Editor, Gallery and Store.
- **Tags** - Tags are especially useful for full-text searching in Gallery and Store. All tags are displayed in the graphics file detail in Editor, Gallery and Store.
- **Workspace** - The workspace where the graphics file file is stored.
- **Final** flag - Helps to distinguish whether or not the graphics file is a final one and should not be edited any further.
- **Thumbnail** - Used for a thumbnail preview of the graphics in the Gallery and in the Store grid.

### New

Whenever you open the Editor, it is automatically prepared to start creating new graphics. If the scene is not empty and you want to create a new graphics file, open the More menu in the top navbar and click New.

### Save

> **⚠ WARNING**: **There is no auto-save function in the Editor**. Any changes made to the graphics must always be saved using the Save button. If the user is logged out after a long period of inactivity, any unsaved changes will be lost.

#### Save for the first time

1. To activate the function for saving a new graphic file, the **scene must contain at least one object**.
2. In the top bar, click on the icon button **Save**.
3. **Complete the form** with the data of the new graphics file.
4. Click on **Save**.
5. The graphics file is now saved in the Gallery.

#### Save continuously

- **Quick Save** – Simply click the Save icon button, if you do not need to change the metadata of the graphic (e.g. title, description).
- **Save with Metadata Change** – Click on the graphics filename, if you want to change some of the metadata of the graphics (e.g. title, description). A form dialog with the graphic file data opens. Confirm the changes by clicking on the Save button.

### Duplicate

To create a duplicate of the graphics file, open the **More** menu in the top bar and click on **Duplicate**. A dialogue will open with a form containing the data of the newly created graphic. **Edit the data** if necessary. Then click on **Duplicate**. The scene now contains the newly duplicated graphic file.

### Clear

Cleans up the entire scene, leaving the file and its metadata stored in the Gallery as they are.

### Delete

Currently, a graphics file cannot be deleted directly from the Editor.
