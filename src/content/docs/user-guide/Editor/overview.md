The editor is composed of several sections:
- In the **top bar**, in addition to the main menu, there are actions for a graphic file.
- In the **left sidebar**, there are buttons for adding basic objects - rectangle, text, image. Objects can be nested in hierarchical structures. The object tree is used to visualize this structure.
- In the **middle** is a scene with a canvas that can be managed with the tools above. The canvas shows the visual form of all objects in the scene.
- The **right sidebar** contains tools for setting the properties of individual objects or animations.
- Animations are rendered in the panel at the **bottom** of the screen. Above the timeline are the tools for setting the timeline, and below the timeline is a drag-and-drop playhead, playback actions, and parameters for setting timeline properties.
