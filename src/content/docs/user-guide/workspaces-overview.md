title: Workspaces Overview
description: Understanding personal and shared workspaces, roles, transactions, and asset management.
---

A **workspace** is a **private (Personal) or shared space** where users manage **graphics files, and assets**. Workspaces allow **collaboration, file organization, and asset sharing** within a team or an individual environment.

## Key Points of Workspaces
- **Store and organize graphics files & assets** (images, image sequences, fonts, and data sources).   
- **Collaborate with team members using different roles and permissions**.  

## Personal and Shared Workspaces

Every user has at least **one Personal Workspace**, and additional workspaces can be created based on the user’s license type:  

| **License Type**    | **Workspaces Available** |
|---------------------|-------------------------|
| **Free License**    | 1 Personal Workspace |
| **Individual License** | 1 Personal Workspace + 1 Shared Workspace |
| **Business License** | 1 Personal Workspace + 1 Shared Workspace (with 1 additional member) |
| **Enterprise License** | 1 Personal Workspace + **Unlimited Shared Workspaces** |

:::tip
**Personal Workspaces cannot be shared**—they are for private use only.

### Moving Files Between Workspaces
- Graphics files and their linked assets are workspace-bound.
- If a **graphics file is moved to another workspace**, all its linked **assets (images, fonts, data sources)** copy with it.  

## Members

You can add other workspace members to share and collaborate on different graphics. These members have different roles:
- **Owner** - The user that created the workspace has full rights to manage the workspace. He or she can manage the workspace, its members, and delete the workspace.
- **Admin** - An Admin has the right to manage the workspace, and its members. The Admin cannot delete the workspace.
- **Collaborator** - A collaborator has the right to create and access workspace graphics files. The Collaborator cannot manage the workspace, and its members or access transactions.

With a Business licence, you can add one additional member to your own workspace; with an Enterprise licence, you can add unlimited members to each of your workspaces.


## Workspace Members & Roles

Members in a shared workspace have different levels of permissions:  

| **Role** | **Permissions** |
|----------|---------------|
| **Owner** | Full control: manage workspace, members, assets, transactions, and delete the workspace. |
| **Admin** | Manage workspace, members, and transactions. Cannot delete the workspace. |
| **Collaborator** | Can create and access workspace files. Cannot manage workspace, members, or transactions. |


### Adding Members Based on License
- **Business License** – Can add **1 additional member** to a shared workspace.  
- **Enterprise License** – Can add **unlimited members** to each shared workspace.  

## Managing Assets in Workspaces

Since **assets** (images, fonts, data sources, etc.) are stored in workspaces:  
- **Assets can be shared across multiple graphics files within the same workspace.**  
- **Moving a graphics file to another workspace also moves its linked assets.**  
- **Deleting a graphics file does not delete its assets**—they remain available for reuse.  

🚨 **Editing an asset affects all graphics files using it** within the workspace.

## Key Takeaways

- **Workspaces store and organize graphics files & assets.**  
- **Personal Workspaces are individual-only; shared workspaces allow collaboration.**  
- **Workspace roles define user permissions.**  
- **Assets are workspace-bound but can be shared across multiple graphics files.**
