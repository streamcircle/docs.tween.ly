title: Workspaces Overview
description: Understanding personal and shared workspaces, roles, transactions, and asset management.
---

A **workspace** is a **private (Personal) or shared space** where users manage **graphics files, assets, and coin transactions**. Workspaces allow **collaboration, file organization, and asset sharing** within a team or an individual environment.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Points of Workspaces
- **Store and organize graphics files & assets** (images, image sequences, fonts, and data sources).  
- **Manage coins and transactions** (for paid graphics sales).  
- **Collaborate with team members using different roles and permissions**.  

## Personal and Shared Workspaces

Every user has at least **one Personal Workspace**, and additional workspaces can be created based on the userâ€™s license type:  

| **License Type**    | **Workspaces Available** |
|---------------------|-------------------------|
| **Free License**    | 1 Personal Workspace |
| **Individual License** | 1 Personal Workspace + 1 Shared Workspace |
| **Business License** | 1 Personal Workspace + 1 Shared Workspace (with 1 additional member) |
| **Enterprise License** | 1 Personal Workspace + **Unlimited Shared Workspaces** |

:::tip
**Personal Workspaces cannot be shared**â€”they are for private use only.

### Moving Files Between Workspaces
- Graphics files and their linked assets are workspace-bound.
- If a **graphics file is moved to another workspace**, all its linked **assets (images, fonts, data sources)** copy with it.  

## Coins and Transactions

**Coins** are used for transactions within Tweenlyâ€™s **Store**. They can be **earned, or spent** in **shared workspaces** (but not in Personal workspace).  

- **New shared workspaces start with 5 coins**.  
- **Coins can be earned** by selling graphics in the Store.  
- Transactions are available **only in shared workspaces**, not in Personal one.  

ðŸ‘‰ **Workspace Owners and Admins** can manage coin transactions. 

## Members

You can add other workspace members to share and collaborate on different graphics. These members have different roles:
- **Owner** - The user that created the workspace has full rights to manage the workspace. He or she can manage the workspace and its members, view, and trade coins, and delete the workspace.
- **Admin** - An Admin has the right to manage the workspace, and its members, view and perform coin transactions. The Admin cannot delete the workspace.
- **Collaborator** - A collaborator has the right to create and access workspace graphics files. The Collaborator cannot manage the workspace, and its members or access transactions.

With a Business licence, you can add one additional member to your own workspace; with an Enterprise licence, you can add unlimited members to each of your workspaces.


## Workspace Members & Roles

Members in a shared workspace have different levels of permissions:  

| **Role** | **Permissions** |
|----------|---------------|
| **Owner** | Full control: manage workspace, members, assets, transactions, and delete the workspace. |
| **Admin** | Manage workspace, members, and transactions. Cannot delete the workspace. |
| **Collaborator** | Can create and access workspace files. Cannot manage workspace, members, or transactions. |


### Adding Members Based on License
- **Business License** â€“ Can add **1 additional member** to a shared workspace.  
- **Enterprise License** â€“ Can add **unlimited members** to each shared workspace.  

## Managing Assets in Workspaces

Since **assets** (images, fonts, data sources, etc.) are stored in workspaces:  
- **Assets can be shared across multiple graphics files within the same workspace.**  
- **Moving a graphics file to another workspace also moves its linked assets.**  
- **Deleting a graphics file does not delete its assets**â€”they remain available for reuse.  

ðŸš¨ **Editing an asset affects all graphics files using it** within the workspace.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Takeaways

- **Workspaces store and organize graphics files & assets.**  
- **Personal Workspaces are individual-only; shared workspaces allow collaboration.**  
- **Transactions & coins are available in shared workspaces, not private ones.**  
- **Workspace roles define user permissions.**  
- **Assets are workspace-bound but can be shared across multiple graphics files.**
