Assets are reusable media elements, making it easy to maintain consistent branding. They include:

- **Images** – PNG, JPG, and SVG files used in graphics.
- **Image Sequences** – Animated sequences composed of series of images.
- **Fonts** – Custom fonts for text elements.
- **Data Sources** – External data linked to graphics.

## Assets Creation

Assets are automatically created when used in a graphics file. They are stored in the same workspace as the file.

## How to Access Assets

1. Open the **Gallery** and navigate to the workspace where the graphics file is stored.
2. Assets in that workspace can be used in any new or existing graphics file.

## Managing Assets

- Assets are workspace-bound. They are stored in the same workspace as the graphics file that uses them.
- When moving a graphics file to another workspace, its assets are copied to the new workspace.
- Deleting a graphics file does not delete its assets. They remain available for other graphics files.
- In shared workspaces all workspace members can access the assets.
