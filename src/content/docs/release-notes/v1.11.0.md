# Release notes - Tweenly - 1.11.0

## Timeline Redesign

In this release, we've completely reworked the timeline to provide a more precise and user-friendly editing experience:

- New playhead: The playhead now sits directly above timestamps and animation blocks, making it easier to understand the current position within the timeline.
- Redesigned timeline controls: We’ve updated the UI and interaction logic for key actions, including:
    - Improved timecode input – now fully supported and much more intuitive.
    - Simplified control of timeline playback (play, pause, skip).
    - Refined settings for onInit, onEnd, and repeats.
    - Enhanced display and visibility options for the timeline.

These improvements make working with animations clearer, and more accurate.
