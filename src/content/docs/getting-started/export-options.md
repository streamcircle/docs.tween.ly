:::note
**ZIP Package export is available only with the Unlimited plan.**  In the **Free plan**, only Plain HTML export is supported.

Graphics in Tweenly can be exported in two formats:  

## 1. Plain HTML Export

*Usage: testing, lightweight graphics without heavy assets.*  

- Exports a single **HTML file** with references to assets stored in the Tweenly cloud.  
- Recommended for simple graphics or testing purposes in environments with **stable internet access**.  
- Main benefits:  
  - Smaller export file size.  
  - Quick and easy distribution.  

:::danger
Since **assets remain online**, graphics may not work properly without internet access.

## 2. ZIP Package Export

*Usage: full, offline-ready export.*  

- Exports a **self-contained ZIP package** that includes:  
  - the HTML file  
  - all images, image sequences, and fonts  
  - required libraries  
- Ensures graphics run **reliably without internet connectivity**.  
- Recommended when working with **custom fonts**, **image sequences**, or any graphics with heavy assets.  

## Choosing the Right Format

- Use **Plain HTML** for quick tests, lightweight graphics, or when you want minimal file size.  
- Use **ZIP Package** for production, offline use, or when smooth playback must be guaranteed.
