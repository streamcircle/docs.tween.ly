## Quick Start: Create Your First Graphics

This guide walks you through the essential steps to create and save your first graphics in Tweenly.  

### Step 1: Open the Editor

Once you've logged in, Tweenly automatically directs you to the **Editor**, where you can create and animate graphics.

### Step 2: Create Your First Graphic

1. **Add Objects** to the Scene:
   - Click on the **rectangle**, **text**, or **image** buttons in the **left sidebar** to add these objects to your scene.
   - Once an object is added, use the **canvas** to position and resize it.

2. **Adjust Object Properties**:
   - Select an object on the canvas.
   - In the **right sidebar**, adjust its properties such as color, size, and position.
   - For text objects, you can edit the font, size, and alignment.

3. **Preview Your Graphic**:
   - Use the **Preview** button in the top bar to see how your graphic will look in real-time.


### Step 3: Save Your Graphic

Saving your progress is essential, as Tweenly does not have an auto-save feature.

1. Click the **Save** button in the top bar.
2. A form will open. Fill in the following details:
   - **Title**: Name your graphic file.
   - **Description**: Optionally add a description.
   - **Tags**: Add relevant tags for easier searching in the Gallery.
   - **Workspace**: Choose the workspace where you want to store the file.
3. Click **Save** to store the file in the **Gallery**.

For quick saves during your work, simply click the **Save** icon without changing the metadata.


### Step 4: Explore the Gallery

After saving your file, you can access it in the **Gallery**. The Gallery is where all your graphic files are stored and organized.

- Use the **search bar** to locate your graphic by title, description, or tags.
- You can also filter by status (draft, final, published) or author.

In the Gallery, you can:
- **Open** files to continue editing in the Editor.
- **Duplicate** files to create new versions.
- **Publish** graphics to the Store (for sharing or selling).
- **Export HTML** to download your graphic for external use.


### Step 5: Animate Your Graphic

Now that you've created a static graphic, let's add some animation:

1. **Add Animations**:
   - Select an object in the **canvas**.
   - In the **right sidebar**, click the **Animations** tab.
   - Choose an animation type (e.g., fade in, move, scale) and adjust the timing.

2. **Use the Timeline**:
   - The timeline panel at the bottom of the Editor lets you control when and how long the animations play.
   - Drag objects along the timeline to set when their animation starts and ends.
   - Use the **playhead** to preview the animation.

3. **Preview Animation**:
   - Click **Preview** in the top bar to see your animated graphic in action.


### Step 6: Export Your Work

When you're satisfied with your graphic and animations, you can export it for use outside of Tweenly.

1. Open the **More** menu in the top bar.
2. Click **Export HTML**.
3. The file will be downloaded to your local disk, ready for integration into your broadcast system.
