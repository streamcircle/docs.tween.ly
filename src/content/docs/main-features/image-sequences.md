description: How to create, edit, and manage image sequences in Tweenly.

An **image sequence** is a set of numbered images played in succession to create a frame-by-frame animation. They are useful for **animated backgrounds, complex transitions, or effects** that are difficult to reproduce with vector animation alone.  

:::note
Image sequences **are available in Free and Unlimited plans.** In the **Free plan**, image sequences are exported only in plain HTML format, which requires a very stable internet connection. Even then, smooth playback is not guaranteed, and sequences may appear choppy. In the **Unlimited plan**, image sequences are fully supported in both HTML and ZIP package export, ensuring smooth offline playback.

## Frame Rate Selection

- When creating a new graphics file, a **canvas settings dialog** appears.  
- Select the correct **frame rate**: **25 or 50 frames per second (FPS)** based on the frame rate of your prepared image sequence.  
- Choosing the wrong frame rate may cause playback speed issues and affect animation timing.  

:::caution
Once selected, the frame rate cannot be changed. If the incorrect frame rate is chosen, you must create a new graphics file with the correct setting.

:::tip
**Why Does Frame Rate Matter?**  
Higher frame rates (50 FPS) are ideal for fluid animations but may require more processing power. Lower frame rates (25 FPS) are suitable for simpler sequences and help reduce file size.

## Adding an Image Sequence

1. In the **Left Sidebar**, click **Sequence**.  
2. The **file explorer** opens – select your images and confirm.  
3. The images are **uploaded and sorted by file name** (standard sequential naming supported, e.g. `frame_001.png`, `frame_002.png`, …).  
4. Once the sequence is created:  
   - It appears in the **Object Tree** (Left Sidebar).  
   - Each image is assigned a **timeline keyframe** in the **Bottom Panel (Timeline)**.  
5. You can add **multiple image sequences** to a single graphics file. Large sequences may increase file size, so consider **splitting sequences into separate graphics files** for better performance.  

## Editing an Image Sequence

- Edit an **image sequence object** like any other object in the **Right Sidebar** (adjust width, height, position, etc.).  
- On the **timeline**, you can:  
  - Adjust the **duration** and **start time** of each frame.  
  - Select multiple frames for bulk actions:  
    - Hold **Ctrl (Windows) / Cmd (Mac)** and click frames.  
    - Hold **Shift** and click the first and last frame to select all in between.  
  - **Remove frames** from the sequence, creating gaps.  
  - **Extend the duration** of the previous frame to fill gaps.  

Each scene can contain multiple image sequences, which can be shifted on the timeline or edited independently.  

## Deleting an Image Sequence

An image sequence can be deleted in two ways:  

1. **Delete the sequence object** in the **Left Sidebar**.  
2. **Remove all frames** from the sequence in the **Timeline**.  

## Exporting a Graphics File with an Image Sequence

When exporting a graphics file that contains image sequences, consider how images are stored and accessed:  

### 1. ZIP Package (Recommended)  
- Exports all frames in a **single folder** inside a `.zip` file.  
- Ensures **consistent playback speed** and works fully **offline**.  

### 2. Plain HTML Export (Requires Online Hosting)  
- Generates a **compact HTML file** with frames stored in the **Tweenly cloud**.  
- Reduces export file size but requires a **stable internet connection**.  
- Performance depends on network speed and connection quality.  

:::tip
**Which format should you choose?**  
- **Use ZIP Package** for smooth, reliable playback without network dependency.  
- **Use Plain HTML Export** if you want a smaller export file and your frames can be hosted online.
