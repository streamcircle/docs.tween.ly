description: How to use timeline labels and code triggers to control graphics playback.
---

Code triggers are **blocks of code executed at specific points during timeline playback**. They are especially useful when you need to make your graphics more interactive, automate playback, or synchronize multiple elements.  

:::note
Code triggers are available in the editor for all users, but they are included **in exports only with the Unlimited plan** (both HTML and ZIP package).

## Timeline Labels

Timeline labels are **markers placed on the timeline** that define execution points.  
- Labels can be added to specific points in time.  
- When playback reaches a label, any triggers attached to it are executed.  

## Functions of Code triggers

Code triggers can perform actions such as:  

- **Pause playback** – stop the timeline until further action is triggered.  
- **Jump to another point** – skip to a different timeline position.  
- **Synchronize animations** – align multiple objects or effects.  
- **React to inputs** – respond to API commands or external events.  

## Example Use Cases

- **Programmatic playback control** – pause graphics at a key moment until triggered to continue.  
- **Synchronization** – ensure that animations across multiple scenes run in sync.  
- **API integration** – trigger an animation when receiving a command from a playout system.  

## Benefits

Using Code triggers allows you to:  
- Build more **dynamic and interactive graphics**.  
- Reduce the need for manual user input.  
- Adapt graphics behavior to **external data and workflows**.
