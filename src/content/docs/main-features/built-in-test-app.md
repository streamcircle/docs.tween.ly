---

The Test App allows you to **simulate API inputs** and preview how graphics behave under different conditions. This makes it possible to test dynamic content and verify behavior without requiring a playout or automation system.  

:::note
The Built-in Test App is **available in Free and Unlimited plans.** 
:::

## Using the Test App

1. Open the **Test App** from the main toolbar.  
2. Select a graphic to test.  
3. Enter test values for text, images, or styles.  
   - You can type values manually.  
   - Or let the Test App generate random strings within a defined range (useful for stress testing).  
4. Preview the graphic to see how it behaves with the test input.  

## What Can Be Tested

- **Text fields** – replace values with custom input or randomized text.  
- **Images** – swap image URLs to check scaling, loading speed, and placement.  
- **Tickers** – verify that scrolling or crawling content updates correctly.  
- **Styles and colors** – test alternative formatting without editing the graphic.  

## Benefits

- **Fast validation** – test graphics without external systems.  
- **Error detection** – identify layout issues early (e.g., text overflow or broken image links).  
- **Realistic simulation** – replicate how a graphic will react to incoming API values.  
- **Production readiness** – ensure graphics are stable before export and playout.  

## Best Practices

- Test with both **short and long text values** to confirm that layouts remain consistent.  
- Use **randomized content generation** to quickly stress-test tickers and text objects.  
- Preview image replacement with different **resolutions and aspect ratios**.
